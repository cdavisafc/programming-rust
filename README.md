# programming-rust

I've decided to learn Rust. I bought the book Programming Rust written by Jim Blandy, Jason Orendorff and Leonora Tindall. I'm not the type of person who will just read straight through and do the examples only as written in the text, rather I let my curiousity guide things. This repo is where I'm going to capture my explorations. Maybe it will be of value to someone.
